# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
  Version control is a system that allows you to monitor and save different versions of code that you are working on.  It is useful if you want to see the history of your code, go back to a certain point of your code, or to problem solve. 
* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
  A branch is a copied and edited version of the master code. It is used so that you can make changes to the code without updating the master until you are ready.  
* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
  A commit is a point in which you want to save the work you're doing in your git history.  A good commit message will allow you and anyone who is looking at the git history to know what changes you made.
* **What is a merge conflict?**
  A merge conflict happens when the same parts of the file have been edited and there is conflicting information.  Git does not know which version is correct and will alert you that there is a conflict.
