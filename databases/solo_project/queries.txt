1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
SELECT * FROM employees;

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
UPDATE employees SET number = "619-400-1234" WHERE name="Shannon Keatley";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
SELECT * FROM employees, dept WHERE employees.dept_id = dept.id;

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
SELECT employees.name, dept.name FROM employees JOIN dept ON dept_id = dept.id;

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
DELETE FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 3;

EXAMPLE OF JOINS

1. Inner Joins
SELECT dept_id FROM employees INNER JOIN dept ON employees.dept_id = dept.id;

2. Left Joins
SELECT  number, dept_id FROM employees LEFT JOIN dept ON employees.dept_id = dept.id;
